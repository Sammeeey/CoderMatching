## practices/habits we follow for contributions to the CoderMatching project 

### documentation

- git commits based on [Bolaji's *Writing Good Commit Messages: A Practical Guide*](https://blog.bolajiayodeji.com/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide)
	- using *try* prefix in front of commit messages to indicate non-working commits
	- using branch descriptions (to remember purpose of branch) with [`git branch --edit-description`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8858853) while being on the respective branch
		- [How to find branch description from git command line](https://gist.github.com/ejmr/a927d32e25488a282bd3)

### issue labels / label issues
- always [add a **good first issue** label](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/encouraging-helpful-contributions-to-your-project-with-labels) to when creating an issue which is doable for beginners
- maybe add additional labels if appropriate
